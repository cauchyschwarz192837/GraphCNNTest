# Graph-Convolutional Neural Network for Piezoelectric Coefficient Prediction in Thin Films

This is an implementation of a graph convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the piezoelectric coefficient, $d_{33}$, of various crystalline materials. Baseline regression models such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest and fully connected neural networks (MLP) were implemented for comparative evaluation against the graph-CNN.
